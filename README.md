## SI 699 - Capstone Project: Biased Restaurant Reviews: Starbucks in NYC

In recent years, online customer reviews or product reviews have become the major source for collecting feedback from customers. Restaurant owners could find ways to improve their service or even evaluate whether a new store is easy/hard to gain good ratings and reviews in a specific location by analyzing those online reviews. In this project, we want to explore the factors that cause regional bias in restaurantsâ€™ ratings. We chose Starbucks as the target store to analyze since it is our favorite and the most popular chain store in U.S.A. We are curious about why the same brand with almost the same products could receive different ratings in different locations.
The analysis will first focus on boroughs in New York City due to the time limit and the project scope. By analyzing the online review text with regional data (i.e. income levels) of Starbucks in different regions, we want to answer the following two questions:
1. What factors do customers care about Starbucks?
2. If those factors varied by region? If so, do income levels make them different?
The analysis result of this case study will provide the business owners the insight into how to satisfy the customers and run a business successfully in each region.
